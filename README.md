# Unirest-API-Script
I used a prediction API I found on Mashape that was free and used their request libraries to create a script.
The script is a simple collection of get requests using the Mashape Unirest API. It used the Stockfluence algorithms to predict which stocks are the best ones to invest in by listing out the ones it thinks will rise in the near future. Since I have using the basic version of Stockfluence, I only get data from last year. I also used Mashape, since I can use their authorization key to access Stockfluences data, meaning I also had to use Mashape's scripting libraries, Unirest.
